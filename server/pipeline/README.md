# CAPR - Pipeline

The pipeline takes an input source wordlist, and turns it into a lexicon that is useful for the program.

## burmish-pipeline
Takes the starting wordlist, parsing it into the desired form for manipulation and then running through `LingPy` to generate initial cognate sets and structure alignments.
If you want to run on a different file, simply edit `burmish-pipeline.py` and ensure it has a similar shape to the existing `.tsv`.

## burmish-output
Takes the previously generated cogsets and alignments, creating a merged `.tsv` and viewable text table with reconstructions from the transducers in the `reconstruct` directory.

NOTE: `burmish-output` creates a text formatted table that contains the same "boarded" data as generated by the server's `compile_lexicon_to_json`.
